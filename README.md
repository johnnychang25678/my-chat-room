# My Chat Room
- A chat room web application built with HTML, CSS, vanilla JS, express JS, Socket.io, handlebars, and MongoDB
- A user is able to register, login, logout, and chat in real-time with other users.

# Why build this applicaiton?
- The primary purpose of building this application is to gain a understanding of web sockets and to brush up my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I deliberately employed OOP style in the backend to practice JavaScript's OO syntax.
- This application is not intended to be deployed in a live/production environment; therefore, no security and deployment measures have been applied. If you wish to clone this project for personal use, please make the necessary modifications, such as adjusting the JWT secret and database connection.
